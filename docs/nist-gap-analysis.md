# NIST 800-53 Compliance Gap Analysis

**Date**: 2026-03-11 (updated — COMP-5 stale metrics fix)
**Author**: J. Haist / Claude Code
**Status**: Authoritative source for compliance posture

This document is the single source of truth for Project Sentinel's NIST 800-53 compliance posture. All other documents (SSP, MEMORY.md, task-queue.md, briefing.md) should reference this document rather than stating independent scores.

---

## 1. Methodology

### 1.1 Automated Compliance Check

The script `scripts/nist-compliance-check.sh` runs **125 automated checks** across **17 NIST 800-53 control families**. Each check queries live infrastructure (Wazuh API, SSH to managed hosts, Vault API, OKD API, HTTP health endpoints) and produces a PASS/FAIL/WARN result. Each check maps to exactly one NIST 800-53 control, so 125 checks = 121 unique controls verified (some controls have multiple sub-checks).

The script runs daily at 6:00 AM UTC via systemd timer on iac-control. A separate 11-check API-only subset runs as an OKD CronJob in sentinel-ops namespace (no SSH dependencies).

### 1.2 What the Script Checks

| Family | Controls Checked | Check Count |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| AC (Access Control) | AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, AC-4, AC-5, AC-6, AC-6(1), AC-6(2), AC-7, AC-8, AC-10, AC-11, AC-12, AC-14, AC-17, AC-17(1) | 16 |
| AT (Awareness & Training) | AT-1, **AT-2**, **AT-3** | 3 |
| AU (Audit & Accountability) | AU-2, **AU-2(3)**, AU-3, AU-4, ***AU-5***, AU-6, AU-6(4), ***AU-7***, AU-8, AU-9, **AU-10**, AU-11, AU-12 | 13 |
| CA (Security Assessment) | CA-2, ***CA-5***, CA-7, CA-7(1), ***CA-9*** | 5 |
| CM (Configuration Management) | CM-2, CM-3, CM-3(2), **CM-3(3)**, CM-5, CM-6, CM-7, CM-7(2), CM-8 | 9 |
| CP (Contingency Planning) | CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, CP-4, **CP-6**, CP-7, CP-9, CP-9(1), CP-9(2), CP-10 | 10 |
| IA (Identification & Auth) | IA-2, IA-2(1), IA-2(12), IA-4, IA-5, IA-5(1), IA-5(2), IA-5(3), IA-5(13), IA-8 | 10 |
| IR (Incident Response) | IR-1, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 | 4 |
| MA (Maintenance) | MA-2, ***MA-4*** | 2 |
| MP (Media Protection) | MP-5 | 1 |
| PE (Physical & Environmental) | PE-6, PE-14 | 2 |
| PL (Planning) | PL-1, PL-2, ***PL-4*** | 3 |
| **PM (Program Management)** | **PM-1**, **PM-2**, **PM-6** | **3** |
| RA (Risk Assessment) | ***RA-2***, RA-3, RA-5, **RA-5(3)** | 4 |
| SA (System & Services) | **SA-4**, ***SA-5***, **SA-8**, ***SA-10***, **SA-11**, SA-22 | 6 |
| SC (System & Communications) | SC-1, SC-2, SC-5, SC-7, SC-7(5), SC-7(7), SC-8, SC-8(1), SC-10, SC-12, SC-12(1), SC-13, ***SC-17***, **SC-20**, SC-23, SC-28, SC-39 | 17 |
| SI (System & Info Integrity) | SI-2, SI-3, SI-4, **SI-4(2)**, SI-4(4), SI-4(7), SI-5, SI-6, SI-7, SI-7(1), SI-7(2), SI-7(6), SI-16 | 13 |
| **Total** | **17 families** | **125** |

**Bold** entries are new checks added in Session 67 (15 checks across 2 new families: PM, expanded SA/AT/AU/CP/SC/SI).
***Bold italic*** entries are Phase 2 checks added in Issue #26 (10 checks: AU-5, AU-7, CA-5, CA-9, MA-4, PL-4, RA-2, SA-5, SA-10, SC-17).

### 1.3 What the Script Does NOT Check

The sentinel-moderate profile has approximately 226 applicable controls (after excluding N/A). The automated script checks 121 unique controls, leaving **105 controls with no automated verification** (53.5% coverage, 46.5% gap).

Notable unchecked areas:
- Remaining AC family (AC-19 mobile, AC-20 external systems)
- Most of AT (Awareness & Training) family beyond AT-1/2/3
- Remaining SA controls beyond SA-4/8/11/22
- Most of PM family beyond PM-1/2/6
- SC-4 (info in shared resources)
- Most of PS (Personnel Security) family
- Most of PE (Physical & Environmental) family beyond PE-6/14

### 1.4 Scoring Limitations

The automated check script tests *necessary conditions* for compliance, not *sufficient conditions*. A PASS on `AC-2` (Keycloak OIDC endpoint responding) confirms the IdP is running but does not prove all AC-2 sub-requirements (quarterly reviews, account disabling procedures, etc.) are met.

---

## 2. Current Automated Results

**Last run**: 2026-03-08 (125 checks — Phase 2 expansion)

### 2.1 Summary

| Status | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| PASS | 98 | Checks passing |
| FAIL | 18 | See 2.3 below |
| WARN | 9 | See 2.4 below |
| **Total** | **125** | **78% pass rate** |

**Coverage**: 121 unique controls checked out of ~226 applicable (53.5%). Phase 2 added AU-5, AU-7, CA-5, CA-9, MA-4, PL-4, RA-2, SA-5, SA-10, SC-17.

**Regression note**: Score dropped from 110/115 (96%) on 2026-03-07 to 98/125 (78%) on 2026-03-08. Primary causes: (1) SSH cert expiry cascading SSH-based check failures across multiple hosts, (2) 10 new Phase 2 checks added (some legitimately failing), (3) post-PG-crash service outages (Vault containers, CrowdSec, Cloudflare tunnel). Expected recovery to ~110+/125 once SSH certs are renewed and services restored.

**Note**: The OKD CronJob in sentinel-ops runs a separate 11-check API-only subset (no SSH). That subset may show different results due to MinIO connectivity from OKD pods.

### 2.2 Breakdown by Family (from 2026-03-08 run)

| Family | Checks | PASS | FAIL | WARN | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|------|------|-------|
| AC (16) | 16 | 13 | 3 | 0 | AC-6 (0 Vault policies), AC-6(2) (root SSH 1/5), AC-17 (SSH CA unreadable) |
| AT (3) | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | AT-2 WARN (no training records) |
| AU (13) | 13 | 10 | 1 | 2 | AU-2 FAIL (auditd 1/6), AU-5 FAIL (0/5 failure response), AU-6 WARN, AU-10 WARN |
| CA (5) | 5 | 3 | 1 | 0 | CA-9 FAIL (Vault k8s auth not detected) |
| CM (9) | 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 | All passing (ArgoCD 24/24 synced) |
| CP (10) | 10 | 9 | 1 | 0 | CP-9 FAIL (backup timers: vault-backup + gitlab-backup INACTIVE) |
| IA (10) | 10 | 8 | 1 | 1 | IA-2(12) FAIL (0 non-token auth), IA-5(13) WARN |
| IR (4) | 4 | 1 | 0 | 3 | IR-4 WARN (no AR blocks), IR-5 WARN (0 alerts), IR-6 WARN (no Discord webhook) |
| MA (2) | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | MA-4 FAIL (0/5 SSH-only maintenance) |
| MP (1) | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | Vault encryption active |
| PE (2) | 2 | 2 | 0 | 0 | iDRAC health + physical monitoring |
| PL (3) | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | Security plan + SSP + rules of behavior current |
| PM (3) | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 | PM-2 WARN (no senior official in SSP) |
| RA (4) | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | Vulnerability + secret scanning + DefectDojo + risk categorization |
| SA (6) | 6 | 5 | 0 | 1 | SA-8 WARN (no secure dev lifecycle in CI) |
| SC (17) | 17 | 13 | 4 | 0 | SC-5 FAIL (CrowdSec down), SC-7 FAIL (UFW 1/6), SC-7(7) FAIL (CF tunnel down), SC-17 FAIL (no PKI engine) |
| SI (13) | 13 | 10 | 2 | 1 | SI-3 FAIL (ClamAV), SI-4(4) FAIL (Traefik down), SI-4(2) partial (custom rules) |
| **Total** | **125** | **98** | **18** | **9** | **78% pass rate** |

### 2.3 Known FAIL Causes (18 FAILs as of 2026-03-08)

**SSH cert expiry cascade (likely ~8 of 18):** AU-2, AC-6(2), SC-7 — checks that SSH into multiple hosts fail when JIT certs expire, reporting 1/N hosts instead of N/N.

**Post-PG-crash service outages:** CM-2 (Vault containers DOWN, seedbox 0/2), CP-9 (backup timers inactive), SC-5 (CrowdSec down), SC-7(7) (Cloudflare tunnel down), SI-4(4) (Traefik down on pangolin).

**Vault access issues:** AC-6 (0 Vault policies — token may lack list permission), AC-17 (SSH CA unreadable), IA-2(12) (0 auth methods detected), CA-9 (k8s auth not detected).

**New Phase 2 checks legitimately failing:** AU-5, MA-4, SC-17 — infrastructure gaps not yet addressed.

**SI-3 (ClamAV):** Script still checks for ClamAV which was replaced by Trivy/Kyverno/Cosign. See SEC-24.

### 2.4 Known WARN Causes

| Control | Check | Root Cause | Severity |
|---------|-------|-----------|----------|
| AT-2 | training_records | No formal security awareness training records | Medium |
| AU-6 | wazuh_alerts_24h | No alerts found in Wazuh alerts.json | Low |
| AU-10 | non_repudiation | Wazuh logall_json not enabled | Low |
| IA-5(13) | vault_token_ttl | Cannot determine Vault token max TTL via API | Low |
| IR-4 | wazuh_ar_rules | No active-response blocks detected | Medium |
| IR-5 | alert_volume | Low alert volume (0) — may indicate gaps | Low |
| IR-6 | discord_alerting | No Discord webhook alerting found | Medium |
| PM-2 | senior_official | No senior security official documented in SSP | Low |
| SA-8 | secure_development | No secure development lifecycle checks in CI | Medium |

## 3. Coverage Gap

### 3.1 The Numbers

| Metric | Value | Change from v2.1 |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Total controls in sentinel-moderate profile | ~229 | — |
| Controls marked N/A | ~3 | — |
| Applicable controls | ~226 | — |
| Controls with automated checks | **121 (53.5%)** | was 111 (49%) |
| Controls without automated checks | **105 (46.5%)** | was 115 (51%) |
| Automated checks passing | **98 of 125 (78%)** | was 109 of 115 (95%) |
| Controls with automated evidence | **~98 of 226 (43%)** | was 109 of 226 (48%) |

**Note on regression**: Pass rate dropped from 95% to 78% between Mar 7 and Mar 8 due to SSH cert expiry cascade failures and post-PG-crash service outages. Expected recovery to ~110+/125 (88%+) once SSH certs are renewed (SEC-23) and services restored.

**Metric definitions** (these measure different things — do not conflate):
- **Check count** (125): Number of individual automated tests in the script
- **Control count** (121): Unique NIST controls verified (some controls have multiple sub-checks)
- **Pass rate** (78%): Percentage of automated checks that PASS (degraded — see regression note above)
- **Coverage** (53.5%): Percentage of applicable controls that have automated verification
- **Evidence rate** (~43%): Percentage of applicable controls with automated PASS evidence

### 3.2 Additional Coverage (Non-Automated)

Beyond the 125 automated checks, approximately 50 additional controls have narrative implementation descriptions in the SSP (SSP-overwatch-platform.md) but lack automated verification. These include:
- AC-1, AC-5, AC-17 policy and procedure documentation
- AT-1 through AT-4 awareness and training
- CP-1, CP-3, CP-6 contingency planning documentation
- PL-1, PL-2 security planning
- Various SA (System & Services Acquisition) controls

These narratives represent intent and partial implementation but are not independently verifiable without manual review.

### 3.3 Defensible Score Statement

> **121 of 226 applicable controls have automated compliance checks (53.5%). Of those, 98 currently PASS (78% pass rate, degraded by SSH cert expiry and service outages — see Section 2.3). An additional ~50 controls have narrative-only implementation descriptions in the SSP but lack automated verification. The remaining ~55 controls have no documentation or automation.**
>
> *Previous baseline (v2.1, 2026-03-07): 110/115 passing (96%), 111/226 coverage (49%). Score recovery expected after SSH cert renewal and service restoration.*

## 4. OSCAL Artifact Issues

### 4.1 System Security Plan (SSP)

The SSP in `compliance-vault` has the following status:
- **REPLACE_ME placeholders**: ~~Title, version, system-name, description, authorization-boundary, and system-id fields contain placeholder text~~ **FIXED (Session 60)**
- **Status honesty**: ~~39 "implemented" controls with admitted gaps~~ **FIXED (Session 67)** — 11 controls with genuine remaining gaps downgraded to "partial". 21 controls with resolved-but-lingering gap text cleaned up. 7 controls (cp-6, cp-7, cp-7.3, cp-8, cp-8.1, cp-8.2, au-3.1) were already correctly "implemented".
- **SC-8/SC-8.1 updated (Session 67)**: Added Istio mTLS evidence (STRICT mode, 10 services, 21 AuthorizationPolicies), Vault TLS, SSH CA, WireGuard. SC-8.1 changed from "planned" to "implemented" with full cipher suite documentation.
- **Status distribution** (253 implemented-requirements): 100 implemented, 89 partial, 34 not-applicable, 30 planned
- `trestle validate -a` passes clean

### 4.2 Component Definitions

Six components are defined in the OSCAL component-definition (iac-control, okd-cluster, vault-server, wazuh-siem, gitlab-ci, network-boundary), but all have **empty `implemented-requirements` arrays**. This means:
- `trestle ssp-assemble --compdefs` will fail
- No traceability from controls to implementing components
- The component definitions are structurally valid but semantically empty
- Populating requires mapping 253 SSP controls to components (8-12 hours)

### 4.3 Security Assessment Report (SAR)

The SAR has been reconciled with the SSP (Session 67):
- **SSP/SAR alignment**: ~~106 controls disagreed~~ **FIXED** — 61 SAR-only findings removed, 45 SSP-only findings added. Both now have exactly 253 controls.
- **Status**: 100 satisfied, 153 not-satisfied (aligned with SSP implementation status)
- **Evidence pipeline**: Running daily, generates OSCAL AR from compliance check output
- `trestle validate -a` passes clean on all artifacts

### 4.4 Evidence Pipeline

- **Status**: ~~FAILING since 2026-02-21~~ **OPERATIONAL (Session 67)** — GitLab PAT renewed, evidence pipeline running successfully
- **Production script** (`~/sentinel-repo/scripts/evidence-pipeline.sh`): Runs compliance check, generates OSCAL AR via converter, commits daily reports to compliance-vault
- **OSCAL AR converter** (`~/sentinel-repo/scripts/convert-to-oscal-ar.sh`): Producing valid OSCAL 1.1.2 Assessment Results
- **OKD CronJob version**: Separate 11-check API-only subset

---

## 5. Infrastructure Blockers

### 5.1 SSH Certificate Expiry — RESOLVED (Session 59)

~~JiT SSH certificates on iac-control have expired.~~ Renewed. All 6 remote hosts reachable.

### 5.2 VAULT_TOKEN Not Set — RESOLVED (Session 59)

~~`/etc/sentinel/compliance.env` does not have VAULT_TOKEN set.~~ Token configured. Vault API checks now produce definitive results.

### 5.3 Backup Timers Inactive — RESOLVED (Session 59)

~~vault-backup.timer and gitlab-backup.timer inactive.~~ Restarted on both hosts.

### 5.4 OKD CronJob MinIO Connectivity — PARTIALLY FIXED (Session 60)

The sentinel-ops OKD CronJob had two issues:
1. **MC_CONFIG_DIR**: `mc` binary couldn't write config to `/` (OKD non-root containers). **FIXED** — Added `export MC_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/.mc` to minio-replicate.sh, compliance-scripts.yaml, and evidence-pipeline.sh.
2. **Silent crash**: `mc alias set` errors suppressed by `>/dev/null 2>&1` + `set -euo pipefail`. **FIXED** — Added visible error logging with proper `|| { log "FATAL: ..."; exit 1; }`.
3. **nist-compliance-check CronJob exit code**: Script exited 1 on any FAIL check, causing CronJob "Error" status. **FIXED** — Changed to always exit 0 (report captures failures, CronJob success means script ran).

**Still active**: MinIO network connectivity from OKD pods to ${MINIO_PRIMARY_IP}:9000 may still have issues. The mc config fix resolves the immediate crash but actual bucket operations need verification on next CronJob run.

### 5.5 Expired GitLab PAT for compliance-vault — RESOLVED (Session 67)

~~The git remote URL for `~/compliance-vault` on iac-control contains expired PAT.~~ **FIXED** — New PAT generated and stored in Vault. Git remote updated. Evidence pipeline, SSP updates, and all OSCAL artifact work now operational.

### 5.6 Wazuh MCP Container Auth — FIXED (Session 60)

The Wazuh MCP Docker container on iac-control was running with default credentials (`WAZUH_USER=wazuh`, `WAZUH_PASS=wazuh`) instead of the actual Vault credentials (`wazuh-wui`). This caused 7868 consecutive 401 auth failures and a permanent circuit breaker open state. **FIXED** — Container recreated with correct credentials from `secret/wazuh/api`.

### 5.7 Grafana MCP Token — FIXED (Session 60)

Grafana MCP was returning 401 Unauthorized. **FIXED** — Created new service account `mcp-readonly` (Viewer role) with 90-day token. Updated `~/.mcp.json`. Requires Claude Code restart to take effect.

## 6. Score History Correction

### 6.1 Previous Claims

Prior scores of "64-65% (176-180/276)" were propagated from an informal estimate in the SSP (line 12: "Full SAR: ~185/276 ~67%"). This number:
- Was never computed from an authoritative source
- Did not distinguish between automated evidence and narrative claims
- Was copied across MEMORY.md, task-queue.md, briefing.md, nist-score-history.md, and compliance.md without verification
- Conflated "controls mentioned in documentation" with "controls with evidence of compliance"

### 6.2 Corrected Posture

| Metric | Old Claim (pre-Session 56) | v1.0 (Session 56-58) | v1.1 Current (Session 59+) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| Compliance score | 64-65% (176-180/276) | 24-26% automated evidence | 53.5% coverage (121/226), 78% pass rate (98/125) |
| Automated check pass rate | Not distinguished | 71-77% of 77 checks | **98% of 100 checks** (98 PASS) |
| Total applicable controls | 276 | ~226 | ~226 |
| Controls with any evidence | "176-180" | ~105 (55 auto + ~50 narrative) | ~148 (98 automated + ~50 narrative) |

---

## 7. Phased Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Infrastructure Blockers (Quick Wins) — COMPLETED

~~**Goal**: Unblock 6+ FAIL checks, maximize PASS rate of existing checks.~~

All Phase 1 items completed in Session 59:
1. ~~Renew JiT SSH certs~~ — Done
2. ~~Set VAULT_TOKEN in compliance.env~~ — Done
3. ~~Restart backup timers~~ — Done
4. ~~Verify UFW active~~ — Done (6/6 hosts)

**Result**: 98/100 PASS (98% pass rate), up from ~55/77 (71%)

### Phase 2: OSCAL Artifact Cleanup

**Goal**: Make OSCAL artifacts internally consistent and defensible.
**Effort**: 4-8 hours.

1. Fix SSP REPLACE_ME placeholders (title, version, system-name, description, authorization-boundary, system-id)
2. Downgrade 39 "implemented-with-gaps" controls to "partial" in SSP
3. Reconcile SSP vs SAR (106 controls disagree — resolve each one)
4. Populate component-definition `implemented-requirements` for 6 components

### Phase 3: Evidence Pipeline Deployment

**Goal**: Automated daily OSCAL Assessment Results from compliance check output.
**Effort**: 2-4 hours.

1. Clone compliance-vault repo on iac-control
2. Deploy `convert-to-oscal-ar.sh` and `evidence-pipeline.sh` to systemd timer paths
3. Verify OSCAL AR converter produces valid output
4. Run `trestle validate` on updated artifacts
5. Set up evidence-pipeline systemd timer (daily 7AM UTC)

### Phase 4: Expand Automated Coverage (Ongoing)

**Goal**: Increase from 100 to 120+ automated checks (~53% coverage).
**Effort**: Ongoing, incremental.

Priority controls to add automated checks for:
- AT-2, AT-3, AT-4 (training records, role-based training)
- AC-19 (mobile access controls), AC-20 (external systems)
- PM family (program management controls)
- SC-4 (info in shared resources)
- Additional SA controls (SA-4 acquisition process, SA-8 security engineering)

**Target**: 120+ automated checks covering 53%+ of 226 applicable controls.

## 8. CIS Benchmark Status (Wazuh SCA)

### 8.1 Current Scores

| Agent | Host | Benchmark | Score | Pass | Fail | Total |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|------|------|-------|
| 007 | iac-control | CIS Ubuntu 24.04 v1.0.0 | 78% | 209 | 57 | 279 |
| 001 | vault-server | CIS Ubuntu 24.04 v1.0.0 | 79% | 211 | 55 | 279 |
| 002 | pangolin-proxy | CIS Ubuntu 24.04 v1.0.0 | 80% | 214 | 52 | 279 |
| 008 | gitlab-server | CIS Ubuntu 24.04 v1.0.0 | 79% | 211 | 55 | 279 |
| 000 | wazuh-server | CIS Ubuntu 22.04 v2.0.0 | 68% | 137 | 62 | 207 |
| 006 | seedbox-vm | CIS Ubuntu 22.04 v2.0.0 | 68% | 136 | 63 | 207 |

Proxmox hosts (pve, proxmox-node-2, proxmox-node-3) are not Wazuh-managed and have no SCA data.

### 8.2 Failure Categories (iac-control, representative)

57 failing checks fall into these categories:

**Partition layout (24 checks) — NOT REMEDIABLE without rebuild:**
Checks 35510-35535: Separate partitions for /tmp, /home, /var, /var/tmp, /var/log, /var/log/audit with nodev/nosuid/noexec options. VMs were provisioned from cloud-init templates with single-partition layout. Repartitioning requires rebuilding the VM.

**Firewall framework confusion (14 checks) — BY DESIGN:**
Checks 35619-35638: CIS expects a single firewall framework (nftables OR iptables OR ufw). iac-control uses both UFW and raw iptables (for Squid transparent proxy redirect). These are complementary, not conflicting, but CIS flags them as failures.

**dnsmasq/squid/rpcbind services (3 checks) — BY DESIGN:**
Checks 35565, 35572, 35577: CIS says these services should not be running. iac-control runs them intentionally (dnsmasq=DHCP/DNS for OKD, squid=egress proxy, rpcbind=NFS client).

**AppArmor not all enforcing (1 check) — PARTIAL:**
Check 35539: Some AppArmor profiles in complain mode. Can be fixed by enforcing all profiles.

**GRUB bootloader password (1 check) — DEFERRED:**
Check 35540: No GRUB password set. Requires physical/console access to set, low risk for VMs.

**IP forwarding enabled (1 check) — BY DESIGN:**
Check 35608: iac-control forwards traffic between vmbr0 (LAN) and vmbr1 (OKD internal).

**PAM modules (4 checks) — FIXABLE:**
Checks 35672-35689: pam_unix, pam_faillock, pam_pwhistory not enabled/configured per CIS spec. Can be added to `common` Ansible role.

**systemd-timesyncd vs chrony (1 check) — BY DESIGN:**
Check 35589: CIS expects systemd-timesyncd but hosts use chrony (configured in Session 55).

**Logging/audit (8 checks) — PARTIALLY FIXABLE:**
Checks 35710-35760: Remote journal upload auth, rsyslog remote host, logfile permissions, audit log deletion policy, audit tools permissions. Some are fixable via Ansible, others require centralized log infrastructure.

### 8.3 Remediation Priority

| Category | Checks | Effort | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| PAM modules | 4 | Low (Ansible) | +1-2% per host |
| AppArmor enforcement | 1 | Low (Ansible) | +0.4% per host |
| Audit/log permissions | 4 | Low (Ansible) | +1.5% per host |
| rsyslog remote logging | 2 | Medium (needs log server) | +0.7% per host |
| Partition layout | 24 | NOT REMEDIABLE (VM rebuild) | +8.6% per host |
| Firewall framework | 14 | NOT REMEDIABLE (by design) | N/A |
| Required services | 4 | NOT REMEDIABLE (by design) | N/A |

**Achievable target**: ~84-85% CIS score on Ubuntu 24.04 hosts (from 78-80%) by fixing PAM, AppArmor, and audit checks. Partition and firewall checks are structural and accepted as-is.

---

## 9. Non-Remediable Items

This section documents controls and checks that **cannot be remediated** without fundamental infrastructure changes, and what those changes would require.

### 9.1 CIS Benchmark — Structural Limitations

**Partition layout (24 checks per host, ~8.6% of CIS score):**
All VMs use single-partition cloud-init layout. Fixing requires: new Packer templates with custom partition tables (separate /tmp, /home, /var, /var/tmp, /var/log, /var/log/audit), then rebuild every VM. This is a 2-3 day effort affecting 6+ VMs with downtime.

**Firewall framework (14 checks per iac-control):**
iac-control intentionally uses UFW + raw iptables. CIS requires choosing one framework. Fixing requires: migrating all iptables rules to ufw or nftables, removing the other framework. Risk: Squid transparent proxy redirect rules are complex iptables chains that may not translate cleanly to ufw.

**Required services (4 checks on iac-control):**
dnsmasq, squid, rpcbind are architectural requirements. dnsmasq provides DHCP/DNS/PXE for the OKD cluster. Squid provides egress allowlisting. These cannot be removed without replacing with equivalent services.

### 9.2 NIST Controls — Organizational/Process Controls

These NIST 800-53 controls require organizational processes that do not apply to a single-operator homelab:

**Personnel Security (PS family, ~8 controls):**
PS-1 through PS-8 require background checks, personnel screening, termination procedures, and access agreements. Not applicable to single-operator environment. **To become compliant**: Document self-attestation processes, formalize access agreements even for sole operator.

**Program Management (PM family, ~16 controls):**
PM-1 through PM-16 require a formal security program with dedicated staff, risk management framework, enterprise architecture, and critical infrastructure plan. **To become compliant**: Create formal security program documentation. Most can be addressed with policy documents alone (~8 hours of writing).

**Training (AT-2 through AT-4, 3 controls):**
Require formal training programs, role-based curricula, and training records. **To become compliant**: Document self-training schedule, maintain training log (spreadsheet or Mattermost channel), link to relevant certifications/courses.

**Physical Security (PE family beyond PE-6/PE-14, ~16 controls):**
PE-1 through PE-20 cover physical access control, visitor records, environmental protections (fire, water, temperature), delivery/removal tracking. Limited applicability in home environment. **To become compliant**: Document physical security of server room/closet, add temperature monitoring (iDRAC already provides this), document visitor access procedures.

### 9.3 NIST Controls — Technology Gaps

These controls require new services or capabilities not currently deployed:

**AU-10 Non-repudiation (requires log signing):**
Need: Digital signing of audit logs using Vault transit engine or Sigstore. Effort: Medium (2-4 hours to implement, ongoing maintenance). Would add tamper-evident audit trail.

**CP-6 Alternate Storage Site (requires offsite backup):**
Need: Backblaze B2 or similar offsite replication of critical backups. Effort: Low-Medium (Backblaze integration exists, need to wire to MinIO replication). Would satisfy geographic separation requirement.

**RA-5(4) Discoverable Information (requires OSINT scanning):**
Need: Shodan/Censys API integration to check external exposure. Effort: Medium (API integration + scheduled scan). Would validate that internal services aren't accidentally exposed.

**SC-20/21/22 Secure DNS (requires DNSSEC):**
Need: DNSSEC validation in dnsmasq or switch to a DNSSEC-validating resolver. Effort: Low (dnsmasq supports DNSSEC validation). Would protect against DNS spoofing.

**SA-4 Acquisition Process (requires vendor assessment):**
Need: Formal process for evaluating third-party software/services. Effort: Low (documentation only). Create a template for evaluating new tools.

### 9.4 OSCAL Artifacts — Blocking Issues

~~**Expired GitLab PAT for compliance-vault:**~~ **RESOLVED (Session 67)**.

~~**SSP/SAR mismatch (106 controls):**~~ **RESOLVED (Session 67)** — Both now have exactly 253 controls, zero mismatch.

~~**Empty component definitions:**~~ **RESOLVED (Session 67)** — All 6 components populated with 296 implemented-requirements (253 unique controls mapped). Distribution: iac-control (122), okd-cluster (53), vault-server (36), wazuh-siem (31), gitlab-ci (29), network-boundary (25). SSP assembled with `--compdefs` flag successfully.

~~**39 "implemented" controls with admitted gaps:**~~ **RESOLVED (Session 67)** — 11 genuine gaps downgraded to "partial", 21 resolved gaps cleaned, 7 correctly "implemented".

### 9.5 Coverage Ceiling

| Scenario | Coverage | What's Needed |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Current | 53.5% (121/226) | Achieved via Phase 2 expansion (Issue #26) |
| ~~+Priority 2 medium effort~~ | ~~53% (120/226)~~ | ~~9 more checks with multi-host queries~~ **DONE** |
| +Priority 3 documentation | 58% (132/226) | 12 policy/procedure document checks (4-8 hrs) |
| +New capabilities | 62% (140/226) | Log signing, OSINT, DNSSEC (days of work) |
| **Maximum automatable** | **~62% (140/226)** | All of the above |
| Remaining 38% | 100% (226/226) | Organizational processes, formal program, physical security — not automatable |

The ~86 controls (38%) that cannot be automated are primarily PM, PS, PE, AT families requiring human attestation, physical measures, or formal organizational processes.

## 10. Recommendations

1. **This document is the single source of truth** for compliance posture. Other files should reference it, not state independent scores.
2. **Do not conflate automated check pass rate with overall compliance**. 98% of 100 checks passing is not the same as 98% of 226 controls being compliant.
3. **Narrative-only controls should be clearly labeled** as such in any reporting.
4. **Phase 1 blockers are resolved** — focus now shifts to OSCAL artifact cleanup (Phase 2) and evidence pipeline (Phase 3).
5. **Score targets should be stated in terms of automated evidence coverage**, not informal estimates.
6. **OKD CronJob failures** (MinIO connectivity) should be fixed to ensure the sentinel-ops monitoring pipeline works end-to-end.
7. **CIS hardening**: Focus PAM, AppArmor enforcement, and audit permission fixes to reach 84-85% on Ubuntu 24.04 hosts. Accept partition layout and firewall framework failures as structural.
8. **Compliance-vault PAT**: Must be renewed immediately — blocks evidence pipeline, SSP updates, and all OSCAL artifact work.
9. **SSP honesty**: Downgrade the 39 "implemented-with-gaps" controls to "partial" before any external reporting.
10. **Coverage expansion**: Priority 1 quick wins (+10 checks, 2-3 hours) offer the best ROI for improving coverage from 44% to 49%.
11. **Squid egress**: Deploy corrected UFW before.rules and squid.conf via `ansible-playbook --tags squid,egress` on iac-control. HTTPS remains unfiltered (transparent proxy limitation).
12. **Kyverno enforcement**: Resolve existing policy violations (nfs-provisioner, seedbox, homepage) before switching from Audit to Enforce. Document violations as POA&M items if unfixable.

## 11. Backup and DR Verification (v1.3)

### 11.0 Backup Systems Status (2026-02-22)

| Backup | Schedule | Last Success | Replicated | DR Tested |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| Vault (Raft) | Daily 02:00 | 2026-02-22 02:04 | Yes | Yes |
| GitLab (app+config) | Weekly Sun 03:00 | 2026-02-22 03:08 | Yes | Yes |
| etcd (OKD snapshot) | Daily 04:00 | 2026-02-22 04:02 | Yes | **No** |
| Proxmox snapshots | Daily 01:00 | 2026-02-22 01:02 | No (local only) | N/A |
| MinIO replication | Every 6h | 2026-02-22 12:30 | N/A (is the replica) | No |
| Terraform state | Manual | 2026-02-04 (18 days stale) | Yes | No |

**Critical backup gaps:**
- Vault backup reports FAILURE despite successful upload (pruning loop bug with `set -euo pipefail` when encountering filenames without date patterns like `test-replication.txt`)
- Wazuh VM (111) not included in Proxmox snapshot automation (only VMs 200, 201, 205, 109, 107 covered)
- LXC containers (300 config-server, 301 minio-bootstrap, 302 minio-replica) have no snapshots
- Mattermost MinIO bucket (38 MiB) not included in replication script
- etcd restore has never been tested (restore script exists but unvalidated)
- OKD minio-replicate CronJob failing (container crashes, empty logs) — systemd timer works fine
- NIST compliance check OKD CronJob can't verify backup freshness (MinIO credential/network issue from pod)
- `compliance-reports` and `proxmox-snapshots` MinIO buckets referenced in code but don't exist

## 12. Improvements Applied This Session (v1.3)

### 11.1 Squid Egress Filtering Fix (SC-7)

**Problem**: Live Squid config was the 9000+ line default config (not the Ansible template) with allowlist rules appended AFTER `deny all` — making domain filtering dead code. No PREROUTING redirect existed, and port 80/443 were directly forwarded past Squid.

**Fix**: Updated `ufw-before.rules.j2`:
- Added PREROUTING REDIRECT rule for port 80 → Squid port 3128
- Removed direct port 80 FORWARD rule (HTTP now goes through Squid)
- Documented HTTPS limitation (port 443 cannot be domain-filtered without SSL bumping)

**Status**: Template fixed in git. Requires deployment via `ansible-playbook --tags squid,egress`.

### 11.2 Kubernetes NetworkPolicies (SC-7, AC-4)

**Before**: 6 of 12 application namespaces had default-deny NetworkPolicies (homepage, media, monitoring, netbox, nfs-provisioner, pangolin-internal).

**After**: All 12 application namespaces have default-deny + allow-list NetworkPolicies. Added:
- backstage: default-deny, allow-backstage (7007), allow-postgresql, allow-istio-control-plane
- defectdojo: default-deny, allow-django (8080), allow-celery, allow-postgresql, allow-valkey, allow-istio-control-plane
- keycloak: default-deny, allow-keycloak (8080), allow-postgresql, allow-istio-control-plane
- mattermost: default-deny, allow-mattermost (8065), allow-postgresql, allow-istio-control-plane
- sentinel-ops: default-deny, allow-cronjobs (egress-only to Vault/Grafana/MinIO/GitLab/Wazuh)
- harbor: default-deny, allow-harbor-internal (intra-namespace), allow-postgresql, allow-istio-control-plane

Also added Prometheus Istio scrape policies for all 5 new meshed namespaces.

**Status**: In git, pending push. ArgoCD will auto-sync on merge.

### 11.3 Kyverno Policies Git-Sync (CM-3, SI-7)

**Before**: 2 of 6 live ClusterPolicies tracked in git (restrict-image-registries, verify-image-signatures).

**After**: All 6 ClusterPolicies tracked in git:
- disallow-privileged-containers (CM-7, SI-7)
- require-labels (CM-8)
- require-resource-limits (SC-6)
- require-run-as-nonroot (CM-7, AC-6)
- restrict-image-registries (CM-7, SI-7)
- verify-image-signatures (SI-7, CM-14, SA-12)

All remain in Audit mode — existing violations must be resolved before Enforce.

### 11.4 Wazuh MCP Fix (Prior session continuation)

Wazuh MCP container recreated with correct credentials from Vault. 7868 auth failures resolved.

### 11.5 Grafana MCP Token (Prior session continuation)

New service account `mcp-readonly` created with 90-day token. Updated `~/.mcp.json`.
